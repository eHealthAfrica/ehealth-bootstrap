## Table of contents

- [Quick start](#quick-start)
- [Custom eHealth Elements and Attributes](#custom-ehealth-elements-and-attributes)

## Quick start

Four quick start options are available:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git`.

Read the [Getting started page](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) for information on the framework contents, templates and examples, and more.

## Custom eHealth Elements and Attributes

### Arrows for Alerts

The eHealth theme includes three additional class types to add a small arrow to any side of an alert box, to help make clear what the alert refers to:

![](screenshots/alert-arrow.png)

These are bootstrap style, so they require three classes to work:

  - `.arrow` for the base styles
  - `.arrow-dir-XX` for the direction of the arrow (`up`, `rt`, `dn` or `lt`)
  - `.arrow-pos-X` for the position along the respective edge (`t`, `r`, `b`, `l` or `c`), meaning top, right, bottom, left or center (avoid pointless combinations, such as `b` with `up` or `dn`)

The arrow automatically takes on the colour of the alert box.

So the red alert box with an arrow pointing up in the center (from the image above) is:

````
    <div class="alert alert-danger arrow arrow-dir-up arrow-pos-c"></div>
````

### Responsive helper classes for floating elements

Sometimes it is helpful to only pull an element on certain screen sizes. The
following helper classes allow to do exactly that:

  - `.pull-right-xs` and `.pull-left-xs`
  - `.pull-right-sm` and `.pull-left-sm`
  - `.pull-right-md` and `.pull-left-md`
  - `.pull-right-lg` and `.pull-left-lg`

In order to have an element be pulled right or left on multiple screen sizes
there are additional utility classes defined as follows:

  - `.pull-*-sm-min` and `.pull-*-sm-max`
  - `.pull-*-md-min` and `.pull-*-md-max`

So `.pull-right-sm-min` is basically a shortcut for not having to apply all of
`.pull-right-sm`, `.pull-right-md`, and `.pull-right-lg` together on the same
element.


## Documentation
